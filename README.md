🛠️ How It Works API Testing with Postman

Gemini API was tested using Postman to verify endpoints, request format, and response structure.

Authentication headers and payload structure were debugged to ensure smooth interaction.

API Integration

After successful testing, the Gemini API was integrated into the backend using HTTP POST requests.

API keys were securely managed using environment variables (.env file).

The frontend sends user input to the backend, which forwards the request to Gemini API and returns the AI response.
